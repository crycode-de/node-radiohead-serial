# radiohead-serial

Communiation between some **RadioHead** nodes and **Node.js** using the *RH_Serial* driver of the RadioHead library.

[RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/index.html) is a Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors.
> RH_Serial Works with RS232, RS422, RS485, RS488 and other point-to-point and multidropped serial connections, or with TTL serial UARTs such as those on Arduino and many other processors, or with data radios with a serial port interface. RH_Serial provides packetization and error detection over any hardware or virtual serial connection.


## Example for using radiohead-serial

The radiohead-serial module is perfect if you want to build your own bus system based on for example RS485.

As a head station you can use a Raspberry Pi mini computer with a USB-RS485 adapter.
The other nodes on the bus can be some microcontrollers (e.g. ATMega8 or Arduino) with an TTL-RS485 converter (e.g. Max485) connected.
